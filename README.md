This repository contains the first task for the Prodigy InfoTech Internship in the Machine Learning domain. The task is to implement a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The goal is to develop a model that accurately forecasts house prices using these key features. By completing this task, interns will gain practical experience in applying linear regression techniques, handling real-world datasets, and refining predictive models. This task is a crucial step in understanding how machine learning models can be used in the real estate market to provide valuable insights and predictions.
